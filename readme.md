# Energity: Mobile Forum on Electrical Issues

Energity is a mobile application focused on addressing issues related to electrical systems' efficiency, autonomy, and safety, aiming to raise awareness among users about energy consumption and challenges in the electrical sector. This repository contains information about the Energity project, its justification, objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.

# Justification

Energity is an application that addresses critical issues related to electrical energy in Brazil:

- **Access to Energy:** 97.8% of households have access to electricity, but effective understanding of consumption is limited.

- **High Cost:** The cost of electricity in Brazil is challenging, with an average Brazilian working 11.1 hours per month to pay the electricity bill.

- **Tax Burden:** About 34.02% of the electricity bill consists of tax charges.

- **Asymmetry in Management:** Lack of access to information prevents consumers from making informed decisions.

Energity seeks to address these challenges by empowering users to understand, discuss, and share information about energy efficiency, electrical safety, and relevant news, promoting more conscientious electricity use.

# Objectives

## General Objective

The main objective of this project is to address issues related to the verification of electrical systems, energy efficiency, autonomy, and user safety. Our central approach involves developing a mobile application in the form of a forum.

## Specific Objectives

- **Communication:** Enable users to communicate with each other, sharing experiences and knowledge related to electrical systems.

- **Relevant Information:** Provide relevant information about energy efficiency, maintenance, and safety in electricity use.

- **Up-to-Date News:** Offer access to up-to-date news about the electrical sector, keeping users informed about changes and updates.

- **Practical Tips:** Provide practical tips for efficient electricity use in daily life.

- **Awareness:** Raise awareness among users about the consequences of poor energy management, including financial and environmental impacts.

# Methodology

## Development of the Energity System

The development of the Energity System, which includes a forum and a news page, followed the principles of software engineering, aiming for project organization and achieving high-quality software, as outlined by Sommerville (2011).

### Development Stages

To achieve our objectives, we divided the development process into several stages, based on Software Engineering concepts:

1. **Scope Definition:** We clearly established the objectives and functionalities that the Energity System should encompass.

2. **Process Model:** We chose an appropriate process model to guide development, ensuring efficiency and organization.

3. **System Requirements:** We documented detailed functional and non-functional system requirements.

4. **Test Cases:** We developed comprehensive test cases to ensure system quality and reliability.

5. **Unified Modeling Language (UML):** We used UML to model and visualize the system, facilitating understanding and planning.

6. **Screen Prototyping:** We created user interface prototypes to validate design and usability.

7. **Database:** We implemented a database to store forum and news information.
